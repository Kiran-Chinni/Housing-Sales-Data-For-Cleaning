# Housing Sales Data for Data Cleaning (Data Munging):

In this project I used the data set downloaded from website related to Hosing Sales Data (Excel format). Here I cleaned the data using SQL queries in Microsoft SQL server management studio.

**Responsibilities:**

•	Data base was created in SQL server and the excel format data sets were imported to database as tables.

•	Identified what the fields must be cleaned and changed the format.

•	Corrected the data format, filled null value with appropriate data, breaking out Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State), Updated columns by removing     different versions, removing duplicates and deleting non required columns.

•	Used various SQL queries like Joins, Update, Cast, Convert, Substring, Charindex, Parsename, Case statement, Common Table Expression, RowNumber, etc.

•	Using SQL queries, I was able to clean the data as required.
